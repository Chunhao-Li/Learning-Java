5.4.3

The maximum number of different strings that can be described by a regular expression with M or operators and no closure operators is M + 1, which happens when all options are different.

Example patterns with M = 4

Pattern 1: (A|B|C|D|E)
Different strings: A, B, C, D, E

The addition of parentheses do not change the result: 
Pattern 2: (A(B|C|D|E|F)G)
Different strings: ABG, ACG, ADG, AEG, AFG

The addition of concatenations do not change the result:
Pattern 3: (ABC|DE|F|GH|IJKL)
Different strings: ABC, DE, F, GH, IJKL
